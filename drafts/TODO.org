   or accent before rest..

** Collect rule ideas mentioned in TODO lists there here

   Rhythmic constraints
   - Restrict rests, e.g.,
     - Accent before rest
     - Longer rests only at the very beginning


*** Todo -- Rhythmic constraints

- ! Less rigid underlying pulse. E.g., try different meter, or define underlying pulse by extra silent voice implementing some accellerating pulse. All notes of the solution must then fall onto start of a note within that extra voice.

- Generalise accent constraint implementation
- Revise/test/fix only-simple-tuplet-offs

- ! Renaissance-inspired texture: 
  - Add rest at beginning of one voice with index rule.
  - Multiple parts controlled with similar rhythm-profile-hr

*** Todo -- Polyphonic template

- Shape melodic shapes 
  - ? Some of Jacopo's mophology constraints? 
    - Avoid pitch repetition, ...
  - Prefer steps
  - Follow BPF

- Add rhythmic constraints

- ? Counterpoint constraints like avoid parallel 5th

- ? Restructure constraints -- somehow avoid copying PWGL boxes...
  OK?

*** Todo -- Renaissance-inspired texture

- Layers with rhythmic offset (some voices starting with rests 
  with index rule), 
  but similar rhythmic profile (BPF)

- Rhythm:
  - accent before rest
  - !? long rests only at beginning

- ?? Harmonic rhythm roughly follows rhythmic profile, but much more slowly
  Problem: how to keep chords and scales aligned? 
  ... no problem if there is only a single scale -- use that instead for
  restricting pitch domain

- Melodic constraints
  - ? Heuristic: prefer smaller steps (but randomise that)
  - ? The shorter the note values the smaller the max interval
  - ? Ballistic curve
  - !? Control interval between local max? In particular high local max...

  - ? Some of Jacopo's mophology constraints?

*** Todo -- Tintinnabuli (implemented for any harmony)

**** Generalise tintinnabuli voice constraints
     Doing the below in terms of software developmemt is easy -- think how to musically use this!
    - M voice: allow for slightly larger skips (e.g., up to maj 3d?) -- concider this variable..
    - T voice: control pitch with BPF?
    - ! Allow T voice and M voice to be pretty independent rhythmically, e.g.,
      - M-voice (very) slow like a cantus (i.e. stands out) -- by allowing for non-harmonic tones can form a  rich melody in terms of its [Tonvorrat]
      - T-voice much faster, like a figuration -- accompaniment (not Paert's ideal anymore, I guess, but in my own mind allow for that) 
      - There can be multiple somehow dependent or independent T-voices
      - M-voice and T-voice in different beat subdivisions or otherwise clearly separate


**** Form
    - ! Somehow get an overall development of form (e.g., pitches for an arch)

**** Rhythm
    - Rather simple rhythm, quasi homophonic -- rhythmic hierarchy
    - Rhythmic motifs
    - Somehow break down into phrases 
      (use this patch to generate single phrase?)

**** Accent constraints
    - Have dissonances on 1st beats of bars
    - ? Allow/force irregular meter changes

**** Melodic constraints
    - ? pitch profile?
    - OK No repetition of pitches within three successive mel notes
    - OK Limit max step size for T voices
    - Limit max (min?) pitch (which voices??), and require that this pitch is included towards the end 

**** Constraint between parts
    - ? Closely restrict range of intervals allowed between parts (9th-10th in case of PÃ¤rt)
    - ?? Counterpoint rules like no parallel 5th?


**** Texture 
    - when going beyond 2 voices -- consider some texture dependencies (imitations), e.g., defined with heuristic profiles


**** OLD

- Rhythm:
  - accent before rest

***** Harmony
     - OK Avoid empty 5th and 4th in two-voice counterpoint



* ! Define rule(s) for following list of values

** Either pitches, rhythm or both follow a given list of pitches/rhythms 

   - Heuristic rule: the closer the pitch/rhythmic value in solution voice is to given voice the better 

   - More abstract variants: heuristic rules where
     - pitch / rhythmic value intervals follow intervals of given list
     - directions (contour) follow directions 

** Voice of a given score extracted and transformed into list as above   

** Allow rhythms/pitches from given score to be transformed in various ways

   Ways to compress music by reducing number of notes, e.g., removing 
   - shorter notes
   - lower notes
   - ? last note of voice or each bar 
   - ... (condition defined by function)

   ? Ways to expand music -- opposite of above    
   
   Slight randomisation

   Bending (e.g., adding/multiplying some BPF value to either rhythmic values or pitches)


* Define rule to follow underlying irregular metric grid

  First check out Orjan's already existing ways to tweak the accent structure of certain time signatures. However, likely this is not flexible enough (e.g., for different claves different accent structures of the same time signature are needed).

  Metric grid defined by extra voice in resulting score: each note represents a strong beat (even different strength of beat could be represented with different pitches)

  Rule implements (simplified form) of accent model where accents fall on strong beats are represented by that extra voice


* Update terminology: rules..

  rules, rule applicators and applied rules

  - Explain terminology in doc
  - Document each def what it is..
