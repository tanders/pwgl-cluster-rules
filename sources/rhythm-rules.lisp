	 "Heuristic constraint: rhythmic values essentially follow a BPF. However, the BPF is slightly processed. Firstly, the BPF values are scaled into the interval [min-scaling, max-scaling]. Secondly, the BPF can be somewhat randomised (amount chosen with rnd-deviation, see below). Also, the BPF becomes somewhat 'curved' (using power 3) to address the distribution of rhythmic values (e.g., 1/16, 1/8, 1/4..) [the latter is a HACK].  

Note that the rule follow-profile-hr is more flexible than the rule rhythm-profile-BPF-hr, but this rule is more easy to use for its purposes. Also, this rule allows for rests to occur at any position of a note (with the same duration).

Args:
  voices (int or list of ints): the voice(s) to which the constraint is applied.
  n (int): number of notes
  BPFs (a BPF or list of BPFs): the BPF to follow. 
  min-scaling (positive number): min dur (e.g, 1/16)
  max-scaling (positive number): max dur

Keyword args:
  rnd-deviation (float): amount by which the resulting value for the heuristic deviates from given BPF. 0 means no deviation, 0.5 means the value may deviate up to 50 percent (to either side).
  permutate (a function): arbitrary permutations of the BPF can be defined by a function expecting a list of numbers and returning a list of numbers of the same length. Such permutations are applied after all internal processing of the BPF. 

NOTE: This rule can apply different BPFs to different voices with different settings. If a list of BPFs is given, then a different BPF is given to each of the voices listed. In that case, all other arguments (except n) can be either single values that are shared by all voices, or a list of different values for the different voices.

;;; Accent Model

#|
;; Musing
Accent-rules must be applied to different score contexts. So, I would need to combine r-note-meter calls with different args (e.g., different format settings and different number of args per rule). However, it will then be difficult to combine the rating of the applied constraints. I basically need reified constraints of the cluster-engine, and likely an additional variable to store the rating. Hm...

What I could easily do is apply multiple accent rules independently. However, I think a strength of the Strasheela accent model is that it allows to combine multiple accent constraints that depend on each other.  


;; TODO:
- Decide: should different accent rules have access to different information (different format settings: :offs, :d_offs, :d_offs_m, :d_offs_m_n)? For now assume the same setting for all
- Add missing args of the Strasheela def

Note N is longer than the preceeding note and not shorter than succeeding note (duration + offsetTime used for calculating the perceived duration). If a preceeding or succeeding note does not exist (in the same temporal container) then the constraint returns 0.

If note is accented then start on a beat OR if not starts on a beat then it most accented.
