;; Tintinnabuli rules 
;; 

#|
Ideas for using tintinnabuli in settings beyond the "Arvo PÃ¤rt sound". Doing the below in terms of software developmemt is easy -- think how to musically use this!?
 - M voice: allow for slightly larger skips (e.g., up to maj 3d?) 
 - T voice: control pitch with BPF?
 - ! Allow T voice and M voice to be pretty independent rhythmically, e.g.,
   - M-voice (very) slow like a cantus (i.e. stands out) -- by allowing for non-harmonic tones can form a  rich melody in terms of its [Tonvorrat]
   - T-voice much faster, like a figuration -- accompaniment (not Paert's ideal anymore, I guess, but in my own mind allow for that) 
   - There can be multiple somehow dependent or independent T-voices
   - M-voice and T-voice in different beat subdivisions or otherwise clearly separate
